# 📧 Email Spam Detection using Support Vector Machines
## 📝 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The dataset contains features extracted from email text content, and the model is trained to effectively distinguish between spam and legitimate emails.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python

- Jupyter Notebook

- Scikit-learn

- NumPy

- Pandas

- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

---

## 📊 Dataset
- The dataset includes features derived from email contents such as:

- Frequency of specific keywords

- Capital letter usage

- Special character frequency

- Each email is labeled as:

  - 1 → Spam

  - 0 → Not Spam
